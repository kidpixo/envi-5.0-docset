  <p>
   Use independent components (IC) analysis on multispectral or hyperspectral datasets to transform a set of mixed, random signals into components that are mutually independent.
  </p>
  <p>

  <p>
   IC transformation serves as a tool for blind source separation, where no prior information on the mixing is available. The transform is based on the non-Gaussian assumption of the independent sources, and uses higher-order statistics to reveal interesting features in typically non-Gaussian hyperspectral datasets. IC transformation can distinguish features of interest even when they occupy only a small portion of the pixels in the image.
  </p>
  <p>
   The applications of IC transformation in remote sensing include dimension reduction, extracting characteristics of the image, anomaly and target detection, feature separation, classification, endmember extraction, noise reduction, and mapping.
  </p>
  <p>
   Compared with Principal Component (PC) analysis, IC analysis provides some unique advantages:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li value="1">
    PC analysis is orthogonal decomposition. It is based on covariance matrix analysis, which is based on the Gaussian assumption. IC analysis is based on non-Gaussian assumption of the independent sources.
   </li>
   <li value="2">
    PC analysis uses only second order statistics. IC analysis uses higher order statistics. Higher order statistics is a stronger statistical assumption, revealing interesting features in the usually non-Gaussian hyperspectral datasets.
   </li>
   <li value="3">
    If the feature of interest (such as anomaly) only occupies a small portion of all pixels, it makes insignificant contribution to covariance matrix. In PC analysis, the feature of interest will be buried in the noisy bands. In IC analysis, the features are distinguished from the noisy bands.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   With IC analysis, you can calculate forward IC rotations and inverse IC rotations.
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li value="1">
    The IC forward calculation is a linear transformation for which
    <span class="DocumentTitleProductName">
     ENVI
    </span>
    does the following:
   </li>
   <li value="2">
    Centers and whitens the sample data using the mean, eigenvectors, and eigenvalues of the sample data, and applies PC rotation for data whitening.
   </li>
   <li value="3">
    If you changed the number of output bands,
    <span class="DocumentTitleProductName">
     ENVI
    </span>
    reduces the dimension of the data by subsetting the whitened sample data. Dimension reduction is not recommended for anomaly or target detection, as those signals occupy only a small portion in the image and could be buried in the noisy bands of PC rotation during data whitening.
   </li>
   <li value="4">
    Performs negentropy maximization using the whitened sample to estimate the IC transform matrix.
   </li>
   <li value="5">
    Transforms the input file using the forward IC transform matrix.
   </li>
   <li value="6">
    <p>
     If you selected to sort the IC bands by 2D spatial coherence,
     <span class="DocumentTitleProductName">
      ENVI
     </span>
     sorts the bands in descending order. Components generated by the IC rotation are not prioritized in the original transform, which could mean a noisy band appears as the first IC band. When you use 2D spatial coherence sorting, IC bands that contain spatial structure and most of the information appear first, and IC bands that contain little spatial structure and more noise appear last.
    </p>
    <p>
     A 2D spatial coherence measure is the average of two correlation coefficients. One correlation coefficient is calculated between each spectral band and a version of itself, offset by one line. The other correlation coefficient is calculated between each spectral band and a version of itself, offset by one sample.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
   You have the option to reduce the dimensions of IC bands based on eigenvalues during data whitening.
  </p>
  <p>
   One application of using the inverse IC transform is to remove noise from the data. You could:
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li value="1">
    Perform a forward transform on all of the bands.
   </li>
   <li value="2">
    Determine which bands contain the coherent images by examining the output images.
   </li>
   <li value="3">
    Run the inverse IC transform using a spectral subset that contains only the good bands.
   </li>
  </ol>

   You can calculate forward transforms by calculating new statistics, by using a previously calculated statistics file, or by using an existing transform.

   You also have the option to reduce the dimension of IC bands, and to generate output of only the IC bands that you need.

  <h3>
   Compute New Statistics and Rotate
  </h3>
  <p>
   Follow these steps to calculate the forward IC rotation transform.
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li value="1">
    From the Toolbox, select
    <b>
     Transform &gt; ICA Rotation &gt; Forward ICA Rotation New Statistics &amp; Rotate
    </b>
    . The Independent Components Input File dialog appears.
   </li>
   <li value="2">
    Select the input file and perform optional spatial and spectral
    <a href="../../NoTOCTopics/Subsetting.htm">
     subsetting
    </a>
    , and/or masking, then click
    <b>
     OK
    </b>
    . The Forward IC Parameters dialog appears.

   <li value="3">

    </a>
    Click
    <b>
     Sample Spatial Subset
    </b>
    to define the sample data based on a spatial subset or the area under an ROI. Defining a sample spatial subset smaller than the whole image can fit the IC sample into memory and increase computation speed, and helps concentrate the IC analysis on the features of interest in the spatial subset or ROI.
   </li>
   <li value="4">
    If you did not apply masking at file input, enter the
    <b>
     Sample X/Y Resize Factors
    </b>
    in the appropriate fields to sub-sample the data when calculating the IC transform. Sub-sampling reduces the IC sample size to fit into memory and increases computation speed. This option is valid only on images with an x,y size greater than 64. A setting of 1 (the default) does not change the data. For example, on an image with an x,y greater than 64, a resize factor of 0.5 will use every other pixel in the statistics calculations and the IC sample. Beware that setting this value to a small number could lose features of interest, as those pixels may be discarded. The upper limit is 1.0. The lower limit limits x/y size after downsampling to 64.
