   Select a Spectrograph Definition File
  </h2>
  <p>
   The spectrograph definition file is used to assign the spectral features that are used to correct the wavelength calibration for hyperspectral input images. FLAASH includes built-in spectrograph definitions for the AVIRIS, HyMap, HYDICE, HYPERION, CASI, and AISA sensors. If the input image is from another hyperspectral sensor, or you wish to customize the built-in spectrograph definitions you must provide your own spectrograph definition file.
  </p>
  <p>
   To select a file, click
   <b>
    Spectrograph Definition File
   </b>
   and navigate to the file on disk.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Spectrograph Definition file is an ASCII text file which contains one line for each spectrometer in the sensor. Each spectrometer’s line contains the following information:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li value="1">
    The wavelength (in nanometers) of the reference absorption feature being used to correct the wavelength calibration. If no reliable absorption feature is contained within the span of the spectrometer, then no correction can be made and this value should be set to zero.
   </li>
   <li value="2">
    The full-width half-maximum (FWHM) factor for the reference absorption feature. A wavelength span equal to:
   </li>
  </ul>
  <pre class="indent">
   4*(FWHM factor)*(mean FWHM)
  </pre>
  <p class="indent">
   on each side of the reference absorption feature is used to find the bands needed for identifying the feature. The exact value of the FWHM factor is not critical for a successful wavelength recalibration. Values between 0.5 and 1.5 tend to work well for hyperspectral sensors with critical sampling (where the FWHM is approximately equal to the band spacing). If no reference absorption feature exists for the spectrometer, then set this factor to zero.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li value="1">
    The first band number in the spectrometer relative to the first band in the sensor (starting at band number 1).
   </li>
   <li value="2">
    The last band number in the spectrometer relative to the first band in the sensor.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   The required format of the file is illustrated in the following example, which depicts the default Spectrograph Definition File for the AVIRIS sensor:
  </p>
  <pre class="indent">
   ; FLAASH spectrograph definition for AVIRIS
   <br />
   spectrograph = {0., 0., 1, 32}
   <br />
   spectrograph = {760.17, 0.6, 33, 96}
   <br />
   spectrograph = {0., 0., 97, 160}
   <br />
   spectrograph = {2058.7, 1.5, 161, 224}
  </pre>
  <p>
   The first line in the file is a comment (comments can be placed anywhere in the file, but must be preceded with the semi-colon character). Each of the next four lines contain a spectrograph definition for one of the AVIRIS instrument's four spectrometers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The first spectrometer contains instrument bands 1-32, but does not span any known absorption feature that can be used to recalibrate the wavelengths (so the first 2 values are set to zero). The second spectrometer contains instrument bands 33-96, and the oxygen feature at 760.17 nm is used as the reference absorption feature, with a FWHM factor of 0.6. The third spectrometer contains instrument bands 97-160, but does not contain any reliable features. The fourth spectrometer contains bands 161-224, and the CO2 feature at 2058.7 nm is used, also with a FWHM factor of 1.5.
  </p>
  <p>
   For CASI and AISA, the built-in spectrograph definition file assumes that the collected bands span the 760 nm oxygen feature.

More accurate reflectance retrievals result when adjacency correction is enabled; however, there may be occasions when it is desirable to ignore this effect. Turning adjacency correction off sets ρ

     Modtran Multiscatter Model
    </b>

    <b>
     Isaacs
    </b>
    ,
    <b>
     Scaled DISORT
    </b>
    , and
    <b>
     DISORT
    </b>
    . The default is
    <b>
     Scaled DISORT
    </b>
    with eight streams.
   </li>
   <p>
    The DISORT model provides the most accurate shortwave (less than ~ 1000 nm) corrections, however it is very computationally intensive. The Isaacs 2-stream method is fast but oversimplified. The Scaled DISORT method provides near-DISORT accuracy with almost the same speed as Isaacs. In the Scaled DISORT model, DISORT and Isaacs calculations are performed at a small number of atmospheric window wavelengths. The multiple scattering contributions in each method are identified and ratios of the DISORT and Isaacs methods are computed. This ratio is interpolated over the full wavelength range, and finally, applied as a multiple scattering scale factor in a spectral radiance calculation performed with the Isaacs method. This procedure yields near-DISORT accuracy at window wavelengths, and also improves the accuracy in absorbing regions.
   </p>
   <li value="8">
    If you select
    <b>
     DISORT
    </b>
    or
    <b>
     Scaled DISORT
    </b>
    as the multiscatter model, specify the number of streams: 2, 4, 8, or 16. The number of streams is related to the number of scattering directions evaluated by the model. Calculations with two or four streams are not recommended, as they dramatically increase computation time (over
    <b>
     Isaacs
    </b>
    ) with little or no improvement. Increasing the number of streams for the Scaled DISORT model should not significantly increase processing time.
   </li>
   <p>
    Use of the DISORT multiscatter model dramatically increases FLAASH processing time, and is rarely necessary for accurate atmospheric corrections. The magnitude of multiple scattering in any scene is dependent on the amount of haze (water vapor and aerosols) that are present. Moreover, scattering preferentially affects the shorter (visible) wavelengths; longer (near infrared) wavelengths are minimally affected. You should only consider using the DISORT model in the most severe cases, when haze is very strong and critical correction of the shortest wavelengths is required. Computation times vary with system resources, but typical relative computation times are:
   </p>
   <p>
    Isaacs: DISORT-2: DISORT-4: DISORT-8: DISORT-16 = 1: 22: 24: 30: 60
   </p>
   <p>
    That is, running DISORT with 8 streams usually takes about 30 times longer than using Isaacs. In addition, a combination of DISORT (with any number of streams) and a MODTRAN resolution of 1 cm-1 is extremely computationally intensive.

  </h2>
  <p>
   For instruments that use a non-nadir viewing geometry, you must specify the zenith and azimuth angles. The zenith angle is defined at the sensor as the angle between the line of sight and the zenith (180 for nadir-viewing sensors). Zenith angles must be positive and between 90 and 180 degrees. The azimuth angle is defined as the azimuth (the angle between the line of sight and due North) of the sensor as viewed from the ground. This angle is arbitrary for nadir-viewing sensors. Azimuth values must be between -180 and 180 degrees. For example, if your azimuth from the sensor is 90 degrees (due east), then the azimuth from the ground is -90 degrees (due west).

    toggle button to specify whether or not to use tiled processing. Like all

    processing routines, FLAASH processes the input data in pieces (called tiles), then reassembles the tiles after processing is complete to produce the final result. Using tiled processing allows FLAASH to run on images of any size, regardless of system resources (that is, available memory).
   </li>
   <p>
    The default setting in FLAASH is to use tiled processing (
    <b>
     Yes

    ). Tiled processing is highly recommended; however, some cases occur when FLAASH runs faster without tiling.

    field. The default tile size is set to the larger of your
    <b>

    system preference or 100 MB. See

     ENVI Classic
    </span>
    Help for details on this preference.
   </p>
   <p>
    When processing, FLAASH ensures that the largest piece of the image that is read into memory at any time never exceeds the tile size. It is recommended that the tile size be set to the largest value that does not leave the rest of the computer system deprived of memory for essential functions. For single user machines, a reasonable estimate is about 75% of the installed RAM.
   </p>
   <p>
    Large datasets that contain many pixels with values of 0 (such as a projected Landsat scene) may cause the FLAASH process to fail because the tile can return all “0” pixels. An error message may appear in a popup window and in the file
