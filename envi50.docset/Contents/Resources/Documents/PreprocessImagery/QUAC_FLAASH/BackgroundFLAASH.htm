   FLAASH™
  </h2>
  <p>
   Unlike many other atmospheric correction programs that interpolate radiation transfer properties from a pre-calculated database of modeling results, FLAASH™ incorporates the MODTRAN® radiation transfer code. You can choose any of the standard MODTRAN model atmospheres and aerosol types to represent the scene; a unique MODTRAN solution is computed for each image.
  </p>
  <p>
   FLAASH also includes the following features:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li value="1">
    Correction for the adjacency effect (pixel mixing due to scattering of surface-reflected radiance)
   </li>
   <li value="2">
    An option to compute a scene-average visibility (aerosol/haze amount). FLAASH uses the most advanced techniques for handling particularly stressing atmospheric conditions, such as the presence of clouds.
   </li>
   <li value="3">
    Cirrus and opaque cloud classification map
   </li>
   <li value="4">
    Adjustable spectral polishing for artifact suppression.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   FLAASH starts from a standard equation for spectral radiance at a sensor pixel,
   <i>
    L
   </i>
   , that applies to the solar wavelength range (thermal emission is neglected) and flat, Lambertian materials or their equivalents. The equation is as follows:
  </p>
  <p>
   <img src="../../Resources/Images/PreprocessImagery/flaash_equation1.gif" />
  </p>
  <p>
   Where:
  </p>
  <p class="indent">
   ρ is the pixel surface reflectance
  </p>
  <p class="indent">
   ρ
   <span style="vertical-align: sub;">
    e
   </span>
   is an average surface reflectance for the pixel and a surrounding region
  </p>
  <p class="indent">
   S is the spherical albedo of the atmosphere
  </p>
  <p class="indent">
   L
   <span style="vertical-align: sub;font-weight: normal;font-style: italic;">
    a
   </span>
   is the radiance back scattered by the atmosphere
  </p>
  <p class="indent">
   A and B are coefficients that depend on atmospheric and geometric conditions but not on the surface.
  </p>
  <p>
   Each of these variables depends on the spectral channel; the wavelength index has been omitted for simplicity. The first term in Equation (1) corresponds to radiance that is reflected from the surface and travels directly into the sensor, while the second term corresponds to radiance from the surface that is scattered by the atmosphere into the sensor. The distinction between r and re accounts for the adjacency effect (spatial mixing of radiance among nearby pixels) caused by atmospheric scattering. To ignore the adjacency effect correction, set ρ
   <span style="vertical-align: sub;">
    e
   </span>
   = ρ. However, this correction can result in significant reflectance errors at short wavelengths, especially under hazy conditions and when strong contrasts occur among the materials in the scene.
  </p>
  <p>
   The values of A, B, S and L
   <span style="vertical-align: sub;font-weight: normal;font-style: italic;">
    a
   </span>
   are determined from MODTRAN calculations that use the viewing and solar angles and the mean surface elevation of the measurement, and they assume a certain model atmosphere, aerosol type, and visible range.

   are strongly dependent on the water vapor column amount, which is generally not well known and may vary across the scene. To account for unknown and variable column water vapor, the MODTRAN calculations are looped over a series of different column amounts, then selected wavelength channels of the image are analyzed to retrieve an estimated amount for each pixel. Specifically, radiance averages are gathered for two sets of channels: an absorption set centered at a water band (typically 1130 nm) and a reference set of channels taken from just outside the band. A lookup table for retrieving the water vapor from these radiances is constructed.

    water retrieval
   </a>
   (for example, Landsat or SPOT), the column water vapor amount is determined by the user-selected atmospheric model.
  </p>
  <p>
   After the water retrieval is performed, Equation (1) is solved for the pixel surface reflectances in all of the sensor channels. The solution method involves computing a spatially averaged radiance image L
   <span style="vertical-align: sub;font-weight: normal;font-style: italic;">

   , from which the spatially averaged reflectance ρ

  </p>
  <p>
   <img src="../../Resources/Images/PreprocessImagery/flaash_equation2.gif" />
  </p>
  <p>
   Spatial averaging is performed using a point-spread function that describes the relative contributions to the pixel radiance from points on the ground at different distances from the direct line of sight. For accurate results, cloud-containing pixels must be removed prior to averaging. The cloudy pixels are found using a combination of brightness, band ratio, and water vapor tests, as described by
   <a href="#Matthew">

   The FLAASH model includes a method for retrieving an estimated aerosol/haze amount from selected dark land pixels in the scene. The method is based on observations by
   <a href="#Kaufman">
    Kaufman et al. (1997)
   </a>
   of a nearly fixed ratio between the reflectances for such pixels at 660 nm and 2100 nm. FLAASH retrieves the aerosol amount by iterating Equations (1) and (2) over a series of visible ranges, for example, 17 km to 200 km. For each visible range, it retrieves the scene-average 660 nm and 2100 nm reflectances for the dark pixels, and it interpolates the best estimate of the visible range by matching the ratio to the average ratio of ~0.45 that was observed by
   <a href="#Kaufman">
    Kaufman et al. (1997)
   </a>
   . Using this visible range estimate, FLAASH performs a second and final MODTRAN calculation loop over water.

   Spectral Polishing
  </h2>
  <p>
   Spectral polishing is a term used by
   <a href="#boardman">
    Boardman (1998)
   </a>
   for a linear re-normalization method that reduces spectral artifacts in hyperspectral data using only the data itself. The basic assumptions are as follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li value="1">
    The artifacts may be removed by applying a uniform linear transformation (that is, channel-dependent gain factors and offsets) to the spectra.
   </li>
   <li value="2">
    Spectrally smooth reference pixels (for example, soil or pavement) can be found within the scene from which the transformation can be derived.
   </li>
   <li value="3">
    The true spectra of the reference pixels can be approximated by applying a spectral smoothing operation.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   The gains and offsets are generated from the reference pixels by performing a linear fit of the smoothed spectra to the original spectra. Boardman’s original algorithm, which smooths by Legendre polynomial fitting, is available from the Toolbox under
   <b>
    Radiometric Correction &gt; EFFORT Polishing
   </b>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The FLAASH polishing algorithm yields similar results with less input data. The smoothing is performed with a running average over
   <i>
    n
   </i>
   adjacent channels (where
   <i>
    n
   </i>
   is defined as the polishing width). Spectrum endpoint and missing-channel complications are limited if only a modest amount of smoothing is desired (
   <i>
    n
   </i>
   is low). For example, a polishing width of 2 is useful for removing residual sawtooth noise caused by a dark current offset between odd-numbered and even-numbered channels, as seen in early AVIRIS data. A wider polishing width (for example, 5 to 11) is better for removing larger-scale artifacts such as atmospheric absorption band residuals.
  </p>
  <p>
   The reference pixels are selected as follows:
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li value="1">
    For each pixel, a smoothed spectrum is calculated.
   </li>
   <li value="2">
    The difference between the smoothed spectrum and the unsmoothed spectrum is calculated for each measured wavelength.
   </li>
   <li value="3">
    The RMS of the smoothed-unsmoothed difference at each wavelength is calculated, and normalized by dividing by the mean reflectance over all wavelengths for the pixel.
   </li>
   <li value="4">
    The pixels with the lowest ten percent of normalized RMS differences are selected from among the cloud-free, non-blank, and non-vegetated pixels.
   </li>
   <li value="5">
    The normalized RMS differences for the selected pixels are put into a histogram, and the pixels that fall into the lower half of the histogram are selected to be reference pixels for the calculation of the gain. This eliminates artifacts often found using EFFORT with a vegetated scene.
   </li>
   <li value="6">
    The gain factor for the linear transformation is computed as the ratio of the RMS smoothed to RMS un-smoothed spectrum for these pixels. There is no offset in the transformation. For this reason, very dark pixels such as water are essentially unaffected by the FLAASH polishing.

   Wavelength Calibration
  </h2>
  <p>
   An accurate wavelength calibration is critical for atmospherically correcting hyperspectral data. Even slight errors in the locations of the band center wavelengths can introduce significant errors into the water retrieval process, and reduce the overall accuracy of the modeled surface reflectance results.
  </p>
  <p>
   When you recalibrate wavelengths,
   <span class="DocumentTitleProductName">
    ENVI
   </span>
   creates a file that summarizes the results. The output file is saved to the FLAASH output directory and is named
   <i>
    rootname + wl_recalibration.txt
   </i>
   . In addition, a message summarizing each spectrograph's wavelength correction is written in the journal file under the heading “Determined Wavelength Shift Using NODD Algorithm.” One shift and variance value exist for each spectrograph. The shift value indicates the average wavelength shift in channels, as computed from a number of pixels near the centerline of the image; the variance value indicates the uncertainty in the shift determination. In some cases, both the shift and variance are zero. This can occur when wavelength calibration errors are not present, or when no absorption feature is available within the spectral range of the spectrograph, preventing a wavelength correction from being performed. The FLAASH reflectance output file contains the new wavelength assignments.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you find that the corrected wavelengths are an improvement after the FLAASH processing is complete, you may want to apply them to the original input radiance image. To do this, select
   <b>
    Raster Management &gt; Edit ENVI Header
   </b>
   from the Toolbox, then select
   <b>
    Edit &gt; Attributes
   </b>
   from the Header Info dialog menu bar. You can automatically import the new wavelengths using the FLAASH output file called
   <i>
    rootname + wl_recalibration.txt
   </i>
   . If you choose to do this, then any further processing of the radiance file in FLAASH should be done with the
