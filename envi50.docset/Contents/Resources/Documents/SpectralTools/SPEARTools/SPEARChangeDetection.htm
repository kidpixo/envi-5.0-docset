   The SPEAR Change Detection tool provides a way to compare imagery collected over the same area at different times and to highlight features that have changed. There are two forms of change detection: absolute and relative. Absolute change detection highlights specifically what has changed, e.g. forest to grassland. Relative change detection shows that something has changed but does not specify what that change is. Relative change detection provides a faster method for quickly comparing images.
  </p>
  <p>
   The SPEAR Change Detection tool performs the following types of relative change detection:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li value="1">
    <b>
     Transform
    </b>
    : Input datasets are stacked into one image cube, then an image transform (principle component analysis, minimum noise fraction, or independent components analysis) is applied in order to extract the feature correlating to change.
   </li>
   <li value="2">
    <b>
     Subtractive
    </b>
    : Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), red/blue ratio, and man-made ratio are calculated for the input datasets. The resulting ratios and input bands are subtracted from the input images to create difference images.
   </li>
   <li value="3">
    <b>
     Two Color Multi-View (2CMV)
    </b>
    : One band from the Time 1 image is displayed in the red band, and the same band in the Time 2 image is displayed in the green and blue bands. Objects that display a difference that is brighter from one image to the other appear in cyan. Objects that display a difference that is darker from one image to the other appear in red. The colors can then be used to indicate potential areas of change.
   </li>
   <li value="4">
    <b>
     Spectral Angle
    </b>
    : This method computes the spectral angle between corresponding pixel spectra in the Time 1 and Time 2 images. The spectral angle measures the spectral similarity between the two spectra.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   For best results, use images with similar view geometries. Different view geometries may cause objects such as trees and structures to “lean” in different directions. Because these issues cannot be resolved in coregistration, they cause artifacts in the results.

    For the Subtractive method, select whether you wish to perform dark object subtraction and/or radiometric normalization. Dark object subtraction removes haze and performs atmospheric correction. Radiometric normalization normalizes the overall brightness of the Time #2 image to the Time #1 image based on bands. If a pixel is unchanged between the two images, the digital number (DN) difference will be zero.
