   texture filters to imagery. Many images contain regions characterized by variation in brightness rather than any unique value of brightness.
   <i>
    Texture
   </i>
   refers to the spatial variation of image tone as a function of scale. To be defined as a distinct textural area, the gray levels within the area must be more homogeneous as a unit than areas having a different texture.
   <span class="DocumentTitleProductName">
    ENVI
   </span>
   supports several textural filters based on either occurrence measures or co-occurrence measures.

  <p>
   Use
   <b>
    Occurrence Measures
   </b>
   to apply any of five different texture filters that are based on occurrence measures. The occurrence filters available are data range, mean, variance, entropy, and skewness. Occurrence measures use the number of occurrences of each gray level within the processing window for the texture calculations.

   Co-occurrence-Based Filters
   <a name="kanchor344">

  </h2>
  <p>
   Use
   <b>
    Co-occurrence Measures
   </b>
   to apply texture filters that are based on the co-occurrence matrix. These filters include mean, variance, homogeneity, contrast, dissimilarity, entropy, second moment, and correlation. A setting for gray scale quantization levels is also available, to reduce the number of shades of gray required to represent the image (which also reduces processing time).
  </p>
  <p>
   Co-occurrence measures use a gray-tone spatial dependence matrix to calculate texture values. This is a matrix of relative frequencies with which pixel values occur in two neighboring processing windows separated by a specified distance and direction. It shows the number of occurrences of the relationship between a pixel and its specified neighbor. For example, the co-occurrence matrix shown below was produced using each pixel and its horizontal neighbor (shift values of x=1, Y=0) for a 3x3 window. The pixels in the 3&#160;x&#160;3 base window and the pixels in a 3x3 window that was shifted by 1 pixel are used to create the co-occurrence matrix.
