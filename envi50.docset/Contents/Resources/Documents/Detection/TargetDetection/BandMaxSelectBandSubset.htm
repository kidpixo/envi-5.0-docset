  <p>
   The Select Optimal Bands panel represents step 4 in the
   <a href="SAMTargetFinderWithBandMax.htm#workflow">
    workflow
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Here, you will customize the band subset used to suppress your backgrounds. The BandMax algorithm calculates a significance value for each band in the input image. This unitless value ranges from 0 to 1, where a higher value indicates the band has a higher probability of distinguishing a target response from a background response. BandMax compares the significance value to a significance threshold to derive a subset of bands, based upon the current list of targets and backgrounds.
  </p>
  <p>
   BandMax calculates the significance threshold by attempting to select 25% of the input bands, but never fewer than six bands. However, in some cases, even using a threshold of 0 (the lowest) does not provide an adequate number of bands. In this case, it is best to modify your selection of
   <a href="BandMaxSelectTargets.htm">
    targets
   </a>
   or
   <a href="BandMaxSelectBackground.htm">
    backgrounds
   </a>
   (typically by removing one or more) and run the BandMax algorithm again.
  </p>
  <p>
   The results of the BandMax calculations are shown in the right part of the panel. You can customize the number of bands that will be chosen for SAM analysis (step 3 of the Wizard workflow) by modifying the values in the following steps.
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li value="1">
    Review the
    <b>
     Significant Bands
    </b>
    <b style="font-weight: normal;">
     list,
    </b>
    which shows the bands that BandMax automatically determined were significant when you clicked
    <b>
     Next
    </b>
    in the Background Selection and Rejection panel
    <b style="font-weight: normal;">
     .
    </b>
   </li>
   <li value="2">
    <p>
     Modify the
     <b>
      Band Significance Threshold
     </b>
     value as needed. The threshold ranges from 0 to 1. Only bands with a significance value greater than or equal to the significance threshold will be used. Setting the
     <b>
      Band Significance Threshold
     </b>
     to a higher value results in fewer selected bands in the subset.
    </p>
    <p>
     The increase/decrease buttons change the threshold by increments of 0.01. An increase in the
     <b>
      Band Significance Threshold
     </b>
     value decreases the
     <b>
      Number of Significant Bands
     </b>
     value and updates the
     <b>
      Significant Bands
     </b>
     <b>
      list
     </b>
     . If a change of 0.01 is not enough to update the
     <b>
      Number of Significant Bands
     </b>
     , increase the increment until it does.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li value="3">
    <p>
     You can also decrease the
     <b>
      Number of Significant Bands
     </b>
     <b style="font-weight: normal;">
      value
     </b>
     , which increases the
     <b>
      Band Significance Threshold
     </b>
     value and updates the
     <b>
      Significant Bands
     </b>
     <b style="font-weight: normal;">
      list
     </b>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     The increase/decrease buttons change the number of bands by at least 1. If two or more bands have the same significance value, a greater increment is used to include all of these bands.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li value="4">
    Click
    <b>
     Save Significant Bands to File
    </b>
    if you want to save the band subset in the
    <b>
     Significant Bands
    </b>
    list to an ASCII file. When you have derived the subset of bands that effectively detects your targets, you may want to use this same band subset to perform a series of classifications on a set of images from the same sensor. You can use this output ASCII file as input when spectrally subsetting a file.

    list form a band subset that is used as input in the following SAM analysis.
