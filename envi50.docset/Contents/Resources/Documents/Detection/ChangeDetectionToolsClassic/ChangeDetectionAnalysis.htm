   Change Detection Analysis
  </h1>
  <p>
   Change Detection Analysis encompasses a broad range of methods used to identify, describe, and quantify differences between images of the same scene at different times or under different conditions. You can use many of
   <span class="DocumentTitleProductName">
    ENVI
   </span>
   's tools (such as Band Math or Principal Components Analysis) independently, or in combination, as part of a change detection analysis. In addition, the routines found under the Toolbox menu
   <b>
    Change Detection
   </b>
   offer a straightforward approach to measuring changes between a pair of images that represent an initial state and final state. Use
   <b>
    Change Detection Statistics
   </b>
   for classification images; use
   <b>
    Change Detection Difference Map
   </b>
   for gray scale (single-band) images.

  <p>
   Use
   <b>

   </b>
   to produce an
   <span class="DocumentTitleProductName">
    ENVI
   </span>
   classification image characterizing the differences between any pair of initial state and final state images. The input images may be single-band images of any data type. The difference is computed by subtracting the initial state image from the final state image (that is,
   <i>
    final
   </i>
   &#160;-&#160;
   <i>
    initial
   </i>
   ), and the classes are defined by change thresholds. A positive change identifies pixels that became brighter (final state brightness was greater than the initial state brightness), while a negative change identifies pixels that became dimmer (final state brightness was less than initial state brightness).
  </p>
  <p>
   As an optional pre-processing step, you can normalize the input images to a data range between zero and one, or standardize them to a zero mean and unit variance. The input images must be coregistered or georeferenced. For the most accurate results, carefully coregister the images before processing. If the input images are not coregistered, the
   <b>
    Change Detection Difference Map
   </b>
   tool uses the available map information to automatically coregister the images, using the initial state image as the base if re-projection or resampling is required.

  <h3>
   Tips for Successful Analyses
  </h3>
  <p>
   When performing a change detection analysis on non-thematic images (gray scale data), it is important to consider all of the factors that can cause scenes of the same area to look different. The following are a few notable factors:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li value="1">
    <b>
     Differences in the instrument or sensor
    </b>
    : Consider the similarity of the sensors that collected the images. Even bands collected in the same part of the spectrum (for example, two red bands) may have different band center wavelengths, or different spectral response functions, which can lead to different pixel values for the same material.
   </li>
   <li value="2">
    <b>
     Differences in the collection date and time
    </b>
    : Seasonal changes can impart big differences in scenes containing vegetation (due to plant senescence and canopy architecture development). Differences in the season and time of day will also affect the solar azimuth and elevation.
   </li>
   <li value="3">
    <b>
     Differences in Atmospheric Conditions
    </b>
    : The dominant weather conditions can affect atmospheric transmission and scattering. Consistent differences in gross atmospheric conditions are often associated with seasonal changes. For example, differences in the predominant wind direction can be important (winds blowing in over the ocean contain different aerosols with different scattering properties from those blowing in over an urban area). Another common, yet consistent, atmospheric difference is the water content of the atmosphere. Summer atmospheres tend to be wetter than winter atmospheres. Atmospherically corrected images can reduce such influences.
   </li>
   <li value="4">
    <b>
     Differences in Image Calibrations
    </b>
    : For the most accurate change detection results, it is important to work with images that are calibrated into the same units. If a calibration into physical units (such as radiance) is not possible, a relative calibration may be better than none at all (especially if the instruments that collected the images have different dynamic ranges).
   </li>
   <li value="5">
    <b>
     Differences in Image Resolution
    </b>
    : Differing pixel sizes can lead to false change detections. It is important that the original images (prior to resampling or re-projection) have the same pixel resolution. For scenes with large swaths (such as AVHRR, SeaWiFS, or MODIS) the actual pixel sizes differ across the scene. In such cases, differences in the sensor viewing geometry can also be important.
   </li>
   <li value="6">
    <p>
     <b>
      Coregistration Accuracy
     </b>
     : Accurately coregistered images are critical for change detection analyses. While the
     <b>
      Compute Difference Map
     </b>
     routine will automatically coregister the input images using the available map information, if the differences in the image geometry are substantial, it is well worth the effort to ensure that the coregistration is as accurate as possible before performing a change detection.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   The
   <b>
    Change Detection Difference Map
   </b>
   tool does not compensate for any of these (or other) conditions. Its results are strictly dependent on pixel-for-pixel comparisons.

   </li>
   <li value="4">
    Enter the number of classes to use. Each class is defined by a difference threshold that represents a varying amount of change between the two images. The minimum number of classes is two. The default classification thresholds are evenly spaced between (-1) and (+1) for simple differences, and (-100%) and (+100%) for percent differences. The default class definitions attempt to produce symmetric classes, with an equal number of positive and negative change classes surrounding a No Change category. The order in which the classes are defined is as follows:
   </li>
   <ul>
    <li value="1">
     For
     <i>
      n
     </i>
     classes, where
     <i>
      n
     </i>
     is odd, the first (
     <i>
      n
     </i>
     /2) classes represent positive changes, starting with the largest positive changes and ending with the smallest.
    </li>
    <li value="2">
     The middle class, (
     <i>
      n
     </i>
     /2) + 1, represents no change.
    </li>
    <li value="3">
     The last (
     <i>
      n
     </i>
     /2) classes represent negative changes, starting with the smallest negative changes end ending with the largest.
    </li>
    <li value="4">
     For an even number of classes the definitions remain the same except that the number of negative classes is reduced by one. In short, the default class definitions range from positive to negative, with the magnitude of the change increasing with distance from the middle No Change class.
    </li>

    </p>
    <p>
     While you are encouraged to customize the criteria to use to define the change thresholds, It is recommended that the classes retain their default symmetrical property, with an equal number of positive and negative classes surrounding a No Change class. Retaining the default position (order) and type (negative or positive) of classes will make the results easier to interpret using the classification color assignments.

   Use

   to compile a detailed tabulation of changes between two classification images. The changes detected using this routine differ significantly from a simple differencing of the two images.

   The Change Detection Statistics Report

  <p>
   The Change Detection Statistics window contains all of the statistics tables that you selected from the
   <b>
    Report Type
   </b>
   field in the Change Detection Statistics Output dialog box, separated by tabs. It also contains a Reference tab, which includes additional information about the analysis, such as the names of the input images and the equivalent class pairings. Below is a sample Change Detection Statistics Report.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
   <img src="../../Resources/Images/change_det.gif" />
  </p>
  <p>
   The statistics tables list the initial state classes in the columns and the final state classes in the rows. However, the columns include only the selected (paired) initial state classes, while the rows contain all of the final state classes. This is required for a complete accounting of the distribution of pixels that changed classes. For each initial state class (that is, each column), the table indicates how these pixels were classified in the final state image. For example, the table in the figure above shows that 2,094 pixels initially classified as Water changed into the Sediment class in the final state image.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li value="1">
    The Class Total row indicates the total number of pixels in each initial state class, and the Class Total column indicates the total number of pixels in each final state class. The table in the figure above shows that 35,989 pixels were classified as Agriculture in the initial state image.
   </li>
   <li value="2">
    <p>
     The Row Total column is a class-by-class summation of all final state pixels that fell into the selected initial state classes.

     This may not be the same as the Final State Class Totals because it is not required that all initial state classes be included in the analysis.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li value="3">
    The Class Changes row indicates the total number of initial state pixels that changed classes. In the table in the figure above, the total Class Changes for Agriculture is 30,923 pixels. In other words, 30,923 pixels that were initially classified as Agriculture changed into final state classes other than agriculture.
   </li>
   <li value="4">
    The Image Difference row is the difference in the total number of equivalently classed pixels in the two images, computed by subtracting the Initial State Class Totals from the Final State Class Totals. An Image Difference that is positive indicates that the class size increased. For example, in the sample analysis, the Water class grew by 67,618 pixels.

   classification images with the class assignments (names, colors, and values) matching the final state. A value of zero in the mask indicates that no change occurred from the initial to the final state; non-zero values indicate a change.

  <p>
   To differentiate pixels that did not change classes from those that changed into the Unclassified class (which typically has a classification value of zero), pixels that changed into the Unclassified class are assigned a value equal to the number of final state classes plus one, and color coded white. For example, in the sample analysis shown in the figure above, the final state image contains 6 classes; therefore, any pixel in the mask that changed into the Unclassified class would be assigned a value of 7.
