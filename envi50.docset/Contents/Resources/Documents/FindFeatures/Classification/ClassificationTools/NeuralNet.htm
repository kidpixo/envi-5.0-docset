   Use
   <b>
    Neural Net
   </b>
   to apply a layered feed-forward neural network classification technique. The Neural Net technique uses standard backpropagation for supervised learning. You can select the number of hidden layers to use and you can choose between a logistic or hyperbolic activation function. Learning occurs by adjusting the weights in the node to minimize the difference between the output node activation and the output. The error is backpropagated through the network and weight adjustment is made using a recursive method. You can use Neural Net classification to perform non-linear classification.

    In the
    <b>
     Training Threshold Contribution
    </b>
    field, enter a value from 0 to 1.0. The training threshold contribution determines the size of the contribution of the internal weight with respect to the activation level of the node. It is used to adjust the changes to a node’s internal weight. The training algorithm interactively adjusts the weights between nodes and optionally the node thresholds to minimize the error between the output layer and the desired response. Setting the
    <b>
     Training Threshold Contribution
    </b>
    to zero does not adjust the node’s internal weights. Adjustments of the nodes internal weights could lead to better classifications but too many weights could also lead to poor generalizations.
   </li>
   <li value="10">
    In the
    <b>
     Training Rate
    </b>
    field, enter a value from 0 to 1.0. The training rate determines the magnitude of the adjustment of the weights. A higher rate will speed up the training, but will also increase the risk of oscillations or non-convergence of the training result.
   </li>
   <li value="11">
    In the
    <b>
     Training Momentum
    </b>
    field, enter a value from 0 to 1.0. Entering a momentum rate greater than zero allows you to set a higher training rate without oscillations. A higher momentum rate trains with larger steps than a lower momentum rate. Its effect is to encourage weight changes along the current direction.

    </p>
    <p>
     If the RMS error, which is shown in the plot during training, falls below the entered value, the training will stop, even if the number of iterations has not been met. The classification will then be executed.

     Number of Hidden Layers

    <b>
     Number of Hidden Layers
    </b>
    to a value of 1 or greater. When the input regions are linearly inseparable and require two hyperplanes to separate the classes you must have a least one hidden layer to solve the problem. Two hidden layers are used to classify input space where the different elements are neither contiguous or connected.
