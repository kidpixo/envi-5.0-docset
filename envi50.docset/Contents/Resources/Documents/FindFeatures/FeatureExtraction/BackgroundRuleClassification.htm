  <h2>
   Rule Classification Background
  </h2>
  <p>
   By default, an OR logical operation is used to combine multiple rules within a class, while an AND operator is used to combine multiple attributes within a rule. This logic works well for building rules in most cases. But you may want to override the default behavior, for example, when you are confident that one rule effectively identifies your feature of interest and you want to promote that rule over the others.
  </p>
  <p>
   You can do this by experimenting with different weight, score, and threshold fields, which are used in combination to assign pixels to classes. By entering your own values to these fields, you will override the default OR/AND logic.
  </p>
  <p>
   This topic explains each of these fields and how they are used.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Assigning Pixels to Classes
  </h3>
  <p>
   In rule classification, a class contains one or more rules.  Each rule contains one or more attribute definitions.  Each class has a score that is defined as follows:
  </p>
  <p>
   <img src="../../Resources/Images/FXRuleBasedClassification/equation_classscore.gif" />
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <b>
    Rule Score
   </b>
   is defined as follows:
  </p>
  <p>
   <img src="../../Resources/Images/FXRuleBasedClassification/equation_rulescore.gif" />
  </p>
  <p>
   (See
   <a href="#attribute_classification_algorithm">
    Attribute Score
   </a>
   and
   <a href="#Attribut">
    Attribute Weight
   </a>
   for more information on these two values.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The default value for
   <b>
    Rule Weight
   </b>
   is
   <b>
    1
   </b>
   for each rule within a class; it displays in the Rule Properties table when you select a rule name. Since multiple rules for a class are combined with an OR logical operator, each rule is equally weighted.
  </p>
  <p>
   The computed
   <b>
    Class Score
   </b>
   is compared to a
   <b>
    Class Threshold
   </b>
   value for that class. The
   <b>
    Class Threshold
   </b>
   is computed as follows:
  </p>
  <p>
   <img src="../../Resources/Images/FXRuleBasedClassification/equation_classthreshold.gif" />
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <b>
    Class Threshold
   </b>
   value displays in the Class Properties table when you select a class name, and it also appears next to the class name. It is automatically computed each time you add attributes to any rule. You can change its value as needed to improve classification results, but you should wait until you have added all rules and attributes. If you add more attributes later, the
   <b>
    Class Threshold
   </b>
   will automatically update and override your entry.
  </p>
  <p>
   If the
   <b>
    Class Score
   </b>
   exceeds the threshold, then the pixel cluster is assigned to the class.  If there are multiple classes with thresholds that have been exceeded, then the pixel cluster is assigned to the class where the threshold was exceeded by the largest value.
  </p>
  <h3>

   </a>
   Attribute Score
  </h3>
  <p>
   An attribute score indicates the likelihood of a segment satisfying the condition of an attribute (for example,
   <code>
    Area &gt; 500
   </code>
   ). The score ranges from 0 to 1.
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="DocumentTitleProductName">
    ENVI
   </span>
   computes the attribute score by first creating a cumulative distribution function (CDF) from the histogram of attribute values. When you select a range of attribute values in the Rule Classification panel, that range is mapped to the CDF curve, along with the
   <b>
    Tolerance
   </b>
   value that you specify. The new minimum and maximum attribute values are mapped to a classification curve. Depending on where the attribute values fall on the classification curve, pixels are excluded from consideration for that attribute (a score of 0), included (a score of 1), or assigned a score in between 0 and 1.
  </p>
  <h4>
   Example
  </h4>
  <p>
   The following is a sample histogram of
   <code>
    Area
   </code>
   &#160;attribute values in a segmentation image. The
   <code>
    Area
   </code>
   values range from approximately 25 to 2600.
  </p>
  <p>
   <img src="../../Resources/Images/FXRuleBasedClassification/histogram.png" alt="sample histogram" />
  </p>
  <p>
   A cumulative distribution curve is computed from the histogram:
  </p>
  <p>
   <img src="../../Resources/Images/FXRuleBasedClassification/cdf.png" alt="CDF curve" />
  </p>
  <p>
   Suppose you limit the
   <code>
    Area
   </code>
   &#160;attribute to values greater than 500 in the Rule Classification panel:
  </p>
  <p>
   <img src="../../Resources/Images/FXRuleBasedClassification/500.png" alt="Area greater than 500" />
  </p>
  <p>
   From this curve, you can see that 60% of the pixels in the segmentation image have
   <code>
    Area
   </code>
   values less than or equal to 500.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you selected
   <b>
    Binary
   </b>
   from the
   <b>
    Algorithm
   </b>
   drop-down list, then
   <code>
    Area
   </code>
   attribute values less than 500 are assigned an attribute score of 0. Attribute values greater than or equal to 500 are assigned an attribute score of 1.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you selected
   <b>
    Linear
   </b>
   or
   <b>
    Quadratic
   </b>
   from the
   <b>
    Algorithm
   </b>
   drop-down list, you need to specify a
   <b>
    Tolerance
   </b>
   value (%). The default value is
   <b>
    5.0
   </b>
   or 5%. The larger the
   <b>
    Tolerance
   </b>
   value you specify, the more you allow nearby pixel clusters to be included in the attribute. For this example, assume the
   <b>
    Tolerance
   </b>
   is
   <b>
    30.0
   </b>
   or 30%. The tolerance is shown in the following CDF&#160;curve:
  </p>
  <p>
   <img src="../../Resources/Images/FXRuleBasedClassification/tolerance.png" alt="Tolerance" />
  </p>
  <p>
   The range of attribute values (300 to 575) is applied to a
   <b>
    Linear
   </b>
   or
   <b>
    Quadratic
   </b>
   classification curve, depending on which option you selected.
  </p>
  <p>
   For the linear curve,
   <code>
    Area
   </code>
   values less than 300 are assigned a score of 0. Values greater than or equal to 575 are assigned a score of 1. Values in between 300 and 575 are assigned an attribute score between 0 and 1, depending on where the value falls in on the linear classification curve:
  </p>
  <p>
   <img src="../../Resources/Images/FXRuleBasedClassification/linear_function.png" alt="Linear classification function" />
  </p>
  <p>
   Attribute scores are similarly determined for the quadratic curve:
  </p>
  <p>
   <img src="../../Resources/Images/FXRuleBasedClassification/quadratic_function.png" alt="Quadratic classification function" />
  </p>
  <p>
   Once the attribute scores are determined, they are multiplied by the
   <b>
    Weight
   </b>
   value that you define (in the Rule Classification panel for a given attribute) to compute the
   <b>
    Rule Score
   </b>
   .
  </p>
  <h3>
   <a name="Attribut">
   </a>
   Attribute Weight
  </h3>
  <p>
   When you select an attribute in the Rule-based Classification panel and click the Advanced tab, the
   <b>
    Weight
   </b>
   value is shown for that attribute. Since multiple attributes within a rule are combined with an AND logical operator, the
   <b>
    Weight
   </b>
   values add up to 1 by default. For example, if you have four attributes within a rule, the
   <b>
    Weight
   </b>
   value for each attribute is
   <b>
    0.25
   </b>
   . You can assign a higher Weight value to an attribute if you are confident that it identifies your feature of interest and you want to promote its rule over other rules. In this case, you will override the default OR/AND logic among rules and attributes.
  </p>
  <p>
   The weights automatically update as you add or remove attributes. You can assign a different
   <b>
    Weight
   </b>
   to an attribute, but you should wait until you have defined all of the attributes for that rule before changing the value.
