   <span class="DocumentTitleProductName">
    ENVI
   </span>
   will compute spatial, spectral, and texture attributes and will generate a segmentation image to which you can add your own attributes or classify however you choose.

  <p>
   To apply a
   <a href="../../NoTOCTopics/WorkingWithMasks.htm">

  <p>
   For best results with Feature Extraction, consider preprocessing your imagery to reduce noisy or redundant data, to correct for atmospheric effects, or to suppress vegetation. See
   <a href="../../PreprocessImagery/PreprocessImagery.htm">
    Preprocess Imagery
   </a>
   for available options.
  </p>
  <p>
   For hyperspectral imagery, we strongly recommend that you run a
   <a href="../../PreprocessImagery/Transforms/PrincipalComponentAnalysis.htm">
    principal components analysis
   </a>
   or
   <a href="../../PreprocessImagery/Transforms/IndependentComponentsAnalysis.htm">
    independent components analysis
   </a>
   on the dataset before using it in Feature Extraction. Segmentation and merging work best on datasets with only a few bands.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also consider reducing the spatial resolution of your input image to speed up processing and to remove small, unwanted features. For example, you can down-sample a 10,000 by 10,000 pixel image by a factor of 10 to yield a 1,000 by 1,000 pixel image.

    Save the regions in the segmentation image to a shapefile. Shapefiles have a maximum file size of 2 GB, so if your image has a large number of segments and the resulting shapefile exceeds this file size, it will be broken into smaller shapefiles. Shapefiles larger than 1.5 GB cannot be displayed. To avoid these issues when working with large datasets, you can save the vectors to a geodatabase.

     Export Attributes Image:

    Create a multi-layer image in ENVI raster format where each layer represents the values of a specific attribute. When you select this option, a new dialog appears that lets you select which attributes to export to an attribute image. The
    <b>
     Selected Attributes
    </b>
    column is initially empty. Select the attribute name(s) that you want to export in the
    <b>
     Available Attributes
    </b>
    column, and click the
    <b>
     Add Selected Attribute
    </b>
