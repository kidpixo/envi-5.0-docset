   Tie points are pairs of pixels corresponding to the same locations where images overlap. They are an integral part of the bundle adjustment and contribute to most of the relative accuracy in the orthorectified product.

    </span>
   </span>
   Be sure that your tie points are of a quality that is consistently better than the initial accuracy of the sensor model; this varies with data type and vendor. For example, mid-latitude QuickBird scenes of a relatively flat area may provide an accurate orthorectification without the use of tie points.

  <p>
   The
   <span class="DocumentTitleProductName">
    ENVI
   </span>
   Orthorectification Module supports tie point files in the following format:
  </p>
  <p class="Code">
   ; ENVI Rigorous Orthorectification TiePoint File
  </p>
  <p class="Code">
   ; FileName0=image1.TIF

; FileName1=image2.TIF

  </p>
  <p>
   The first five lines in this example contain header information that lists the image filenames and the column labels.
  </p>
  <p>
   The header rows that say "FileName
   <i>
    x
   </i>
   " refer to the input image filenames, where
   <i>
    x
   </i>
   is an index number used to reference the filename throughout the rest of the tie points file. In the example above, “0” refers to
   <code>
    image1.TIF
   </code>
   and “1” refers to
   <code>
    image2.TIF
   </code>
   , as indicated in the header.
  </p>
  <p>
   <code>
    195.250000
   </code>
   and
   <code>
    370.250000
   </code>
   are the ImageX and ImageY values for
   <code>
    image1.TIF
   </code>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   <code>
    6562.750000
   </code>
   and
   <code>
    398.250000
   </code>
   are the ImageX and ImageY values for
   <code>
    image2.TIF
   </code>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   If you are creating your own tie point file in a text editor or other application, you do not need to include a full path to the image filenames (in the lines that begin with "FileName
   <i>
    x
   </i>
   ") as long as your filenames are unique. In cases where the filenames may be the same for all images (for example, CARTOSAT-1 and SPOT data), you need to include the full path to each image file in the "FileName
   <i>
    x
   </i>
   " lines.
  </p>
  <p>
   When you restore a tie point file,
   <span class="DocumentTitleProductName">
    ENVI
   </span>
   appends five new columns to the table displayed in the Orthorectification Tie Points List: Correlation, RMSE, DX, DY, and Magnitude.
  </p>
  <p>
   Correlation and RMSE are image-to-image error metrics that are used to estimate the quality of a tie point match. These metrics are calculated for image chips that are the same size as the moving window size and that are centered on the estimated tie point image coordinates. (See Step 4 in
   <a href="#Automati">
    Automatically Generate Tie Points
   </a>
   for a description of moving window size and image chips).
  </p>
  <p>
   DX, DY, and Magnitude show the difference (in meters) in model-predicted map coordinates for the two tie-point image coordinates.
  </p>
  <p>
   The image error metrics and image-to-ground difference metrics can be used to determine potentially poor quality tie points.

    <ul>
     <li value="1">
      <b>
       Number of Tie Points:
      </b>
      Specify the number of tie points to generate. This can be as few as 1, but the recommended value is 6 (default setting).
     </li>
     <li value="2">
      <b>
       Search Window Size:
      </b>
      Specify the search window size, in square pixels. The search window is a defined subset of the image, within which the smaller moving window scans to find a topographic feature match for a tie point placement. The search window size can be any integer greater than or equal to 21, but it must be larger than the Moving Window Size. The default is 101. This value depends upon the accuracy of RPC information of the images, and it also depends on the roughness of terrain.
     </li>
     <li value="3">
      <b>
       Moving Window Size:
      </b>
      Specify the moving window size, in pixels. The moving window scans methodically in the image subset area defined by the Search Window Size, looking for matches to a topographic feature. The moving window size must be an odd integer. The smallest allowable value is 5. The default is 31. Using a larger value results in a more reliable tie point placement, but takes longer processing time; conversely, a smaller value takes less processing time, but the tie points are less reliable. Determining a good moving window size largely depends upon the image resolution and terrain type. Some general guidelines follow:
      <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
       <li value="1">
        For a 10 meters or higher resolution image, use a range of 9–15.
       </li>
       <li value="2">
        For a 5–10 meter resolution image, use a range of 11–21.
       </li>
       <li value="3">
        For a 1–5 meter resolution image, use a range of 15–41.
       </li>
       <li value="4">
        For a 1 meter or less resolution image, use a range of 21–81 or higher.
       </li>
       <li value="5">
        Because most buildings in very high-resolution images in an urban area appear similar, specify a larger value to take the surrounding area into account for more robust matching results. To reduce the computational time for image matching,
        <span class="DocumentTitleProductName">
         ENVI
        </span>
        automatically uses a hierarchical matching method when the moving window size is greater than or equal to 19.
       </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li value="4">
      <b>
       Minimum Correlation:
      </b>
      Specify a floating-point value for the minimum correlation coefficient. Any matches with a correlation coefficient smaller than this value are discarded. The default is 0.55.
     </li>
     <li value="5">
      <b>
       Chip Size:
      </b>
      Specify an integer value for one side of a square image chip size for finding the interest points in the base image. Larger values require more computational time; however, the obtained tie points may be more useful. The default is 128, meaning a 128 x 128 image chip size.
