   Global spatial statistics look for an overall pattern between proximity and the similarity of pixel values. These statistics provide a single value that describes the spatial autocorrelation of the dataset as a whole.
   <span class="DocumentTitleProductName">
    ENVI
   </span>
   offers three global spatial statistics, consisting of the spatial autocorrelation statistics known as Moral’s I, Geary’s C, and semivariance.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li value="1">
    The
    <a name="kanchor55">
    </a>
    Moran’s I index compares the differences between neighboring pixels and the mean to provide a measure of local homogeneity. The value range is between +1 and&#160;-1, where +1 = strong positive spatial autocorrelation, 0&#160;= spatially uncorrelated data, and -1&#160;= strong negative spatial autocorrelation.
   </li>
   <li value="2">
    The Geary’s C
    <a name="kanchor56">
    </a>
    index compares the differences between neighboring pixels to the standard deviation to provide a measure of dissimilarity within a dataset. The value range is between 0 and 2, where 0 = strong positive spatial autocorrelation, 1 = spatially uncorrelated data, and 2 = strong negative spatial autocorrelation.
   </li>
   <li value="3">
    The semivariance
    <a name="kanchor57">
    </a>
    statistic uses the squared difference between neighboring pixel values to provide another measure of dissimilarity within a dataset. It differs from the unitless Moran’s I and Geary’s C indices in that it is in the same units of the input dataset, and the value range is only constrained to be greater than or equal to 0.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   <a name="kanchor58">
   </a>
   While autocorrelation statistics provide an indication of the local homogeneity of a dataset, it is sometimes interesting to understand how that autocorrelation decreases as distance increases. You can examine this using the correlogram or semivariogram. These plots consist of an autocorrelation statistics calculated at various lag distances displayed against the lag. When using the Moran’s I or Geary’s C statistics, this plot is called a correlogram; when using the semivariance statistics, this plot is called a semivariogram.

    option to specify the maximum lag distance, in pixels, to use in the correlogram and semivariogram calculation. The autocorrelation statistics are calculated at each lag distance, up to the specified maximum lag. For example, a value of 5 means that autocorrelation will be calculated for lags of 5, 4, 3, 2, and for each pixel’s nearest neighbors. This value must be greater than 1, but less than the lesser value of the number of rows and columns in the source dataset divided by 4. The default is 2 pixels.
