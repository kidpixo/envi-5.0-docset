   Narrowband Greenness
  </h1>
  <p>
   Narrowband greenness VIs are a combination of reflectance measurements sensitive to the combined effects of foliage chlorophyll concentration, canopy leaf area, foliage clumping, and canopy architecture. Similar to the broadband greenness VIs, narrowband greenness VIs are designed to provide a measure of the overall amount and quality of photosynthetic material in vegetation, which is essential for understanding the state of vegetation. These VIs use reflectance measurements in the red and near-infrared regions to sample the red edge portion of the reflectance curve. The red edge is a name used to describe the steeply sloped region of the vegetation reflectance curve between 690 nm and 740&#160;nm that is caused by the transition from chlorophyll absorption and near-infrared leaf scattering. Use of near-infrared measurements, with much greater penetration depth through the canopy than red measurements, allows estimation of the total amount of green material in the column.
  </p>
  <p>
   Narrowband greenness VIs are more sophisticated measures of general quantity and vigor of green vegetation than the broadband greenness VIs. Making narrowband measurements in the red edge allows these indices to be more sensitive to smaller changes in vegetation health than the broadband greenness VIs, particularly in conditions of dense vegetation where the broadband measures can saturate. Narrowband greenness VIs are intended for use with high spectral resolution imaging data, such as that acquired by hyperspectral sensors.

   The Red Edge Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI

    705

   ) is a modification of the traditional broadband NDVI. It is intended for use with very high spectral resolution reflectance data, such as from hyperspectral sensors. Applications include precision agriculture (an information- and technology-based agricultural management system to identify, analyze, and manage site-soil spatial and temporal variability), forest monitoring, and vegetation stress detection. This VI differs from the NDVI by using bands along the red edge, instead of the main absorption and reflectance peaks. The NDVI
   <sub>

   </sub>
   capitalizes on the sensitivity of the vegetation red edge to small changes in canopy foliage content, gap fraction, and senescence. NDVI&#160;
   <sub>

   is defined by an equation similar to the NDVI:

   Red Edge Position Index
  </h2>
  <p>
   The Red Edge Position (REP) index is a narrowband reflectance measurement that is sensitive to changes in chlorophyll concentration. Increased chlorophyll concentration broadens the absorption feature and moves the red edge to longer wavelengths. The red edge position refers to the wavelength of steepest slope within the range 690&#160;nm to 740 nm. The common range for green vegetation is 700 nm to 730 nm.
  </p>
  <p>
   Results are reported as the wavelength of the maximum derivative of reflectance in the vegetation red edge region of the spectrum in microns from .69 microns to .74 microns. Applications include crop monitoring and yield prediction, ecosystem disturbance detection, photosynthesis modeling, and canopy stress caused by climate and other factors.
