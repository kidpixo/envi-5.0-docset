   Broadband Greenness&#160;
  </h1>
  <p>
   The broadband greenness VIs are among the simplest measures of the general quantity and vigor of green vegetation. They are combinations of reflectance measurements that are sensitive to the combined effects of foliage chlorophyll concentration, canopy leaf area, foliage clumping, and canopy architecture. These VIs are designed to provide a measure of the overall amount and quality of photosynthetic material in vegetation, which is essential for understanding the state of vegetation for any purpose. These VIs are an integrative measurement of these factors and are well correlated with the fractional absorption of photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) in plant canopies and vegetated pixels. They do not provide quantitative information on any one biological or environmental factor contributing to the fAPAR, but broad correlations have been found between the broadband greenness VIs and canopy LAI.
  </p>
  <p>
   Broadband greenness VIs compare reflectance measurements from the reflectance peak of vegetation in the near-infrared range to another measurement taken in the red range, where chlorophyll absorbs photons to store into energy through photosynthesis. Use of near-infrared measurements, with much greater penetration depth through the canopy than red, allows sounding of the total amount of green vegetation in the column until the signal saturates at very high levels. Because these features are spectrally quite broad, many of the broadband greenness indices can work effectively, even with image data collected from broadband multispectral sensors, such as AVHRR, Landsat TM, and QuickBird. Applications include vegetation phenology (growth) studies, land-use and climatological impact assessments, and vegetation productivity modeling.

   Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
  </h2>
  <p>
   <a name="kanchor452">
   </a>
   The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is one of the oldest, most well known, and most frequently used VIs. The combination of its normalized difference formulation and use of the highest absorption and reflectance regions of chlorophyll make it robust over a wide range of conditions. It can, however, saturate in dense vegetation conditions when LAI becomes high. NDVI is defined by the following equation:
  </p>
  <p>
   <img src="../Resources/Images/Vegetation/11_3.jpg" />
  </p>
  <p>
   The value of this index ranges from -1 to 1. The common range for green vegetation is 0.2 to 0.8.

   Simple Ratio Index
  </h2>
  <p>
   The Simple Ratio (SR) index is another old and well known VI. The SR is the ratio of the highest reflectance; absorption bands of chlorophyll makes it both easy to understand and effective over a wide range of conditions. As with the NDVI, it can saturate in dense vegetation when LAI becomes very high. SR is defined by the following equation:
  </p>
  <p>
   <img src="../Resources/Images/Vegetation/11_8.jpg" />
  </p>
  <p>
   The value of this index ranges from 0 to more than 30. The common range for green vegetation is 2 to 8.

   Enhanced Vegetation Index
  </h2>
  <p>
   The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) was developed to improve the NDVI by optimizing the vegetation signal in LAI regions by using the blue reflectance to correct for soil background signals and reduce atmospheric influences, including aerosol scattering. This VI is therefore most useful in LAI regions, where the NDVI may saturate. EVI is defined by the following equation:

   Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index
  </h2>
  <p>
   The Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI) is an enhancement to the NDVI that is relatively resistant to atmospheric factors (for example, aerosol). It uses the reflectance in blue to correct the red reflectance for atmospheric scattering. It is most useful in regions of high atmospheric aerosol content, including tropical regions contaminated by soot from slash-and-burn agriculture. ARVI is defined by the following equation:
  </p>
  <p>

   The value of this index ranges from -1 to 1. The common range for green vegetation is 0.2 to 0.8.

   Sum Green Index
  </h2>
  <p>
   The Sum Green (SG) index is one of the simplest vegetation indices used for detecting changes in vegetation greenness. Because light is strongly absorbed by green vegetation in this spectral region, the SG index is highly sensitive to small changes in vegetation canopy opening, such as what might occur with forest disturbance. The SG index is the mean of reflectance across the 500 nm to 600 nm portion of the spectrum.
  </p>
  <p>
   This sum is then normalized by the number of bands to convert it back to units of reflectance. The value of this index ranges from 0 to more than 50 (in units of % reflectance). The common range for green vegetation is 10 to 25 percent reflectance.
